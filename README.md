   <h1>Hello! My name is Zach Nichols. (he/him)</h1>
   I am a student currently attending Bemidji State University (BSU). I'm new to GitHub, but looking to learn. I currently know Python, C#, C++, Rust, HTML, and CSS to varying degrees. I am currently learning C++, HTML, CSS, JS, and Rust.

  </br>
  I want to get into open source projects, and getting better at using GitHub overall. If you need to reach me, try my Discord: Mr. Fishward#0005 or email me at zachdnichols@gmail.com.
